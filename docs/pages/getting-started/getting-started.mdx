  This package is for projects using React that allows you to write HTML
  elements in which you can pass responsive style props easily. Normally when we
  write and style HTML elements in React we use the standard style props as
  follows:
</Paragraph>

<Code> {`<p style={{ color: 'red, fontSize: '18px' }}>Hello world!</p>`}</Code>

<Paragraph>
  The syntax is a little bit clunky, and gets a bit harder to read as we add
  more and more css rules. And if we wanted to make it responsive, e.g change
  the font size on smaller screens, we'd need to give it a class name and write
  some bulky CSS media queries.

  Using this package means that we get a nicer style props syntax, and can
  easily make this responsive using{" "}
  <a href="https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles">
    Styled System's responsive style syntax
  </a>
  . With this in mind, the example above becomes:
</Paragraph>

<Code>{`<P color="red" fontSize={['16px', '18px']}>Hello world!</P>`}</Code>

<Paragraph>
  Now instead of using the standard style prop we have a prop for every css
  property, e.g color and fontSize. If we want to make a property responsive we
  simply pass an array of strings instead of just one string, where each element
  in the array applies the rule to a certain screen size. In this example, the
  font size is 16px on small screens, and 18px on all larger screens. Notice
  that <Code inline>{`<p>`}</Code> becomes <Code inline>{`<P>`}</Code> - we'll
  discuss this in the next section.

  Installation
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Install <Code inline>html-styled</Code> and its peer dependencies.
</Paragraph>

<Code>yarn add html-styled styled-system styled-components</Code>

<Paragraph>or</Paragraph>

<Code mb={4}>npm install html-styled styled-system styled-components</Code>

<Info title="What are peer dependencies?">
  These are dependencies that we rely on, but instead of bundling them in our
  package we get you to install them separately. This keeps our package size
  down and allows you to install specific versions of each dependency if you
  need to.
