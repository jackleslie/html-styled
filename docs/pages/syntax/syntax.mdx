<Heading mb={1}>Uppercase HTML elements</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  As discussed previously, if we want to write a paragraph in HTML but want to
  utilise responsive style props then we import the paragraph HTML element from{" "}
  <Code inline>html-styled</Code> in uppercase:
</Paragraph>

<Code>{`import { P } from "html-styled"`}</Code>

<Paragraph>
  Now instead of using the standard <Code inline>{`<p>`}</Code> HTML element we
  use <Code inline>{`<P>`}</Code>. With standard elements we can only do inline
  styling through the <Code inline>style</Code> prop, whereas with our new
  component we can pass css rules individually as their own props as well as
  making them responsive props as in <Code inline>styled-system</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Info title="Why are the component names in uppercase?">
  Believe it or not, HTML element names are actually case insensitive so
  uppercase HTML elements are{" "}
  <Anchor href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">
    valid syntax
  </Anchor>
  . However, conventionally developers use lowercase element names; this means you
  can easily spot which elements you write are standard HTML and which ones are from{" "}
  <Code inline>html-styled</Code>. React component names are <Anchor href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">
    normally just capitalised
  </Anchor> as well, so you can also distunguish between normal components and <Code
    inline
  >
    html-styled
  </Code> components.

<Heading mt={5} mb={1}>
  Responsive style arrays
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  When we want to change a CSS rule on different screen sizes we use responsive
  style props as follows:
</Paragraph>

<Code>{`<P color={["red", "blue"]}>Hello world!</P>`}</Code>

<Paragraph>
  This means that on small screens the foreground color is red, and on all
  larger screen sizes the foreground color is blue. This is syntax provided by
  our peer dependency <Code inline>styled-system</Code> - you can read more
  about this syntax in their{" "}
  <Anchor href="https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles">docs</Anchor>.
</Paragraph>

<Heading mt={5} mb={1}>
  CSS selector props
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  When we want to use a CSS selector such as <Code inline>:hover</Code> we use
  object syntax as follows:
</Paragraph>

<Code>{`<P color="red" hover={{ color: "blue" }}>Hello world!</P>`}</Code>

<Paragraph>
  This means that the foreground color is red, and on hover the foreground color
  is blue. Normally to get access to selectors like this we need template
  literals, but using this syntax keeps it similar to responsive style syntax
  and gives us direct access to selectors as a top level prop.
</Paragraph>
