<Heading mb={1}>Uppercase HTML elements</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  As discussed previously, if we want to write a paragraph in HTML but want to
  utilise responsive style props then we import the paragraph HTML element from{" "}
  <Code inline>html-styled</Code> in uppercase:
</Paragraph>

<Code>{`import { P } from "html-styled"`}</Code>

<Paragraph>
  Now instead of using the standard <Code inline>{`<p>`}</Code> HTML element we
  use <Code inline>{`<P>`}</Code>. With standard elements we can only do inline
  styling through the <Code inline>style</Code> prop, whereas with our new
  component we can pass css rules individually as their own props as well as
  making them responsive props as in <Code inline>styled-system</Code>.
</Paragraph>

<Info title="Why are the component names in uppercase?">
  Believe it or not, HTML element names are actually case insensitive so
  uppercase HTML elements are{" "}
  <Anchor href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">
    valid syntax
  </Anchor>
  . However, conventionally developers use lowercase element names; this means you
  can easily spot which elements you write are standard HTML and which ones are from{" "}
  <Code inline>html-styled</Code>. React component names are <Anchor href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">
    normally just capitalised
  </Anchor> as well, so you can also distunguish between normal components and <Code
    inline
  >
    html-styled
  </Code> components.
